Whoever , whatever we want . There is thought. My lord, please no. No no no I beg you, please. Here in the darkness. I give you a coin made from a stone.

Don't break the biding circle. Hmmmmm, sand. Now the jewel. There . Good. Let's see what other treasures you have for us. The bird. No father no. Stop !
Move. We'll let our guest recover . Before we tell him our demands. Guards, watch him.
Magus. Do I know you ? No, but I know all about you Roderick and the being you’ve trapped in your cellar. Blackmail then , Is it ? A shakedown? No at all , I am here to help you . You are going to need all the help you can get. There are benefit to keeping one of the endless close. The endless ? Do you think death was the only one in charge? The reaper has family , you know. Desire, destiny, despair. Which one have I got now? Dream! What's the good of a god who governs dreams? Not a god . More than the god and the man not governed by their dreams ? You've taken his vestments? The ruby , the pouch and the helm. They can lend you an aspect of his power. Extend your lifespan, allow your manipulate others, but you must ensure that he never escapes . The binding circle is intact. The circle will not be enough. You must construct the sphere of glass inside the circle. To contain dream’s physical manifestation. No one must be allowed to fall asleep in his presence , no one. Or he will escape into your dreams and you don’t want that there’s forced march tablets. Stimulants used to keep trench soldiers awake. See your guards use them at all time. Why you are helping me ? What's he to you? Well you could say that he made me what I am today , and If he ever gets free, he could take it all back. We are being observed. What !? There's no body here ! Well you have to deal with that one . Her name is jessamy . She belongs to him. Best of luck to the both of us . Well I see you again ? You should hope not. You can go. Are you awake ?are you listening ?  I know who you are ! Dream of the endless . I captured you according to the laws of magic, but it wasn’t you I wanted . I wanted death to return my son randall who died in the [place name] campaign . If you give him back to me alive , well. I release you . Is that in your power ? Lord of dreams. No I suppose not. So then what can you give me? If I let you go. If I promise to give you back your thing. What ? Power? Wealth? Immortality ? Hmm? Is it noting you can offer me ? Well have it your way then! And until you’re ready speak and enjoy the gift you’ve are already given me. Day after day he pleaded for gifts. That are not mankind’s to receive nor mine to give. So I remained silent. And ten years alter. Enjoy yourself. Of course. though my presence there remained a secret. My ruby ,sand and heml brought youth and prosperity. To redrick burgess and his followers, but for the rest of the world the suffering continued. Alex . You're supposed to be working not reading. Don't let the father catch you. Excuse me . I'm afraid that there’s no more room inside this evening , but if you’d all come back tomorrow. Been out here for hours. We're not going, but I am afraid that the Magus insist. Oh the Magus insist , doesn’t he?
And who are you to speak for the Magus ? Who the fuck are you. He's the Magus son. You fucking twat , aren’t you? Do you want him to put a curse on you. Hex you and all unborn children ? No Then you should leave right now. Can we still come back tomorrow ? Can they ? Yeah , if they bring cash . Oh you heard him. Cash only. Now piss off. Thanks for that. You didn’t need my help. I bet you can do the magic , aren’t you. Can't do much of anything , really. That's not true. You are more powerful than you know. You can get me in to see the magus. I’m not staying with that thing . One second longer than I have to. We can just leave him alone. Why not . He's in his cage. Isn't he? Sometimes I wonder about his job.
Really sometimes? I donot have the morning! You seen noel and maurice? No . They are nearly half hour late. Uh, I could watch him. Until they get here if you wanted to go. See you tomorrow. Cheers, Alex. Hello . It's Alex. Then magus son. See I don’t know whether you can speak or even understand me, but I just wanted to ask. You are all right in there? No of course you aren’t . I'm sorry about all of this. His is not a bad man. My father . He just . If you could bring randoll back, oh just give him something,anything, or even just speak to him. Then I am sure he will let you out. See , I would let you out if I could. You would , would you. What were you doing down there. You were plotting his escape , weren’t you ? Conspiring against me? No Father. What did he say to you. He didn’t say anything . Know what would happen if you let him out. I won’t Magus. I promise. He’d slaughter you. He'd slaughter all of us. Is that what you want? Is it? Do want to die alex ? Do you . Cause if you do. It's relatively simple . Fuck . Roddy? What is it ? What's wrong ? It's jessamy. Who's jessamy ?!!! I've been trying to shoot this werched bird for ten years now. It can’t be the same bird, can’t it. Did he tell you to say that. Did he? No Father . He didn’t say anything. Prove it to me. Shoot the fucking bird. Ethel. Fucking hell. Shall we call the fire brigade? We are the fire brigade . Come On. Idiot. You could have shattered the glass. Clear that mess up. The savagery if my captors bespoke a world whose dreams iin my absence turned darker still. The world which would soon be at war again . The world still ravaged by the disease which doctors named Encephalitis lethargic. I just want to sleep , please. Some begged for sleep that would not come. Others lived as perpetual sleepwalkers. Most slept without waking. Sorry sir. What's that you are reading? I am afraid I am doing much more sleeping than I am reading at the moment . Have you read vile bodies. Now that’ll keep you awake. You are right ?  well I am going to have a baby. That's wonderful news. He want’s me to get rid of it. In fact , he’s calling a doctor right now. What’s it? What's wrong ?  she’s taken it all . The helment. The pouch, the ruby, the grimoire, and 200000 in cash. She's taken far more than that. Find her . Bring her back here now. Where are you going ? To see how badly dream of the endless wants out of his cage. The woman who lives with me has gone, and robbed me of my fortune. She's also robbed you. She's taken your helm, your sand and your ruby . Now I can unlock this , you can go after her , if you give me what I've been asking for. Wealth , youth , immortality. Oh you are a god. These things are nothing to you. Don't you want your weapons, freedom ? Speak to my*2^2 come on speak to me. It's all right father. Get away to me. If you were any kind of son to me. If randall were alive today. He would hate you as much as I do. Sir ? You're never getting rid of that. Never . Sir can you here me? Sir , he is not moving is he? He is dead. Don't do it sir. He'll kill us. What would you father say? I need to think. Sir? Are you all right ? My father he is dead . I am so sorry sir ! I am so sorry alex ! out of loss, new love was born. For nine month later. Ethel Cripps gave birth to a son .my mum used to say that if I was good, when I went to sleep. A man would come, sprinkle sand in my eyes. From now on johnny . You and I are going to have to make our own dreams come true and nothing and no one is going to stand in our way. How's he today rogers?
